// Intuition
// We need to find two numbers in the array that sum up to a given target. Instead of using a brute-force approach that checks all pairs (which would be too slow), we can leverage a hash table (dictionary) to store numbers weâ€™ve seen so far and quickly check if their complement exists.

// Approach
// Create a hash table (num_map) to store numbers along with their indices.
// Iterate through the array:
// Compute the complement of the current number (target - num).
// Check if the complement is already in the hash table.
// If it is, return the indices of the complement and the current number.
// Otherwise, store the current number with its index in the hash table.
// Since there is exactly one solution, we are guaranteed to find a valid pair.
// Complexity
// Time complexity: O(n)

// Space complexity: O(n)
